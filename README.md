### 👋 Hi there

My name is Sean Dominique and I am *__Data Scientist__* with a background in *__bioengineering__* and *__building startups in healthcare__*.

I'm a big believer in moonshots ☄️ - those ambitious ideas today that redefine what's possible tomorrow. If that sounds like you, I'm always happy to chat.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on an analytics pipeline for various stakeholders in healthtech companies to extract the most relevant data for their organization.
- 🧬 I’m interested in preventative health, wearable tech, neuroscience, AI agents.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning dbt, GDPR/HIPAA compliance, and agentic modeling.
